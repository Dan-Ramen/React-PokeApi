# Pokedex (Using PokeApi)

When assigned with this task of creating my own application using an API and React, I originally had a way more ambitious project in mind. Going back to my Battleship project, I had wanted to create a functioning pokemon gym as a game, with character movement using canvas, creating a custom gym layout with a puzzle and trainers with predetermined pokemon teams, ontop of that, making a nintendo blog page with little fan games made by me also using react. But I got too far ahead of myself and didn't anticipate the amount of time it would take to truely understand how to implement everything and make my vision and its scope a reality.

So, I shelved that project and decided to make a pokedex that shows base stats of each pokemon ontop of different abilities the pokemon can have.

The link above takes you to the PokeApi webpage where you can read up on documentation and learn how to use it in your own app as well!

====================

## How to Use my App

Pretty straight forward, Click on the 'Next' or 'Previous' buttons to go to the next or previous pages in the pokedex. Click on the pokemon's card to get its stats displayed.

====================

# Technologies Used
### React
> The bread and butter of this operation...or just the bread in this case since its how this application runs XD

### Axios (Dependency)
> 'npm i axios' Axios is a promise-based HTTP library that lets developers make requests to either their own or a third-party server to fetch data.

====================

# How I Built my Game

### Where do I start?
Well, let me be blunt, this wasn't my first choice. It ended up being a back-up decision due to my ambition and scope being too grand for my time alotted, I guess I had more confidence in my skills before-hand, but outside influences did affect my ability to work on this project as many non-coding issues came up during the week that affected my mental and emotional health.

### The Main Component of my App:
The butter of this little app, _./Components/Main.jsx_: setting up both the html layout for how the pokedex will be displayed as well as all of the fetching and state-setting to your heart's content! (Or rather my heart's content, I did code this app afterall)

Thankfully the use of youtube and the API documentation made it easier to understand how to format all the fetching and such, React is definetely not my strong suit but I feel slightly more confident in my abilities after this project. (Keyword = "SLIGHTLY")

====================

# Acknowledgments
Like my Battleship project, I didn't really work with many people in regards to my code, most of my "Help" was done through extensive solo research on syntax, as well as using youtube to look into other dependencies (Thus Axios was born, well...used in my code, same thing though!).
